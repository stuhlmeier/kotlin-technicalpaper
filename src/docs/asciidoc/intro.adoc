== What is Kotlin?

Kotlin is many things:

**It is cross platform.**
Kotlin's current compilation targets are:

- JVM bytecode
- JavaScript
- Native binaries via LLVM:
* iOS (arm32, arm64)
* MacOS (x86_64)
* Android (arm32, arm64)
* Windows (MinGW x86_64, x86)
* Linux (x86_64, arm32, MIPS, RPi)
* WebAssembly (wasm32)

**It is multi-paradigm.**
Kotlin supports a mix of functional and object-oriented programming to achieve maximum productivity.

Its expansive standard library provides hundreds of utilities,
ranging from basic helpers to entire suites of functions that, to work properly in other less-flexible languages,
would have had to be fully-fledged language features. This is definitely directly not referring to LINQ.

**It is flexible.**
In fact, the Gradle buildscript used to create this document was itself written in Kotlin.
