== Additional resources

In addition to the contents of this paper, a set of official Kotlin
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dan[koans]
can be found online at https://play.kotlinlang.org/koans/overview[play.kotlinlang.org].
These are a set of small Kotlin examples to get you used to the language and assist the learning process.

Additionally, Kotlin's https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference[extensive reference] is an extremely helpful resource, even for veteran Kotlin developers.
It goes into great detail about most, if not all, important parts of the language itself.

Finally, there is always https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/[Kotlin Discussions] and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kotlin[Stack Overflow] if you need personal assistance.
Participants on the Kotlin forums and watchers of the Stack Overflow ``kotlin`` tag (the author included footnote:[https://stackoverflow.com/users/7366707?tab=profile]]) are usually quick to suggest improvements or determine the cause of a bug, provided the question is reasonably phrased.
