=== What is Kotlin?

Kotlin is a programming language developed by JetBrains, the creators of the IntelliJ Java IDE.

It is built on the foundations of the JVM and is highly interoperable with Java code.
Many aspects of Kotlin (generics, arrays, etc.) therefore function almost identically to how they do in Java.
