== Advanced topics

As this paper is primarily an introduction to the Kotlin language itself, it does not include certain advanced use-cases.

The following is a list of incredibly useful language features and links to their references.

- https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/coroutines-guide.html[Coroutines] (``suspend`` functions)
* Enables safe, structured, asynchronous programming without much need for synchronization
- https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/native/faq.html[Kotlin/Native]
* Compiles Kotlin to native binaries -- this is _very_ experimental.
- https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/building-mpp-with-gradle.html[Multiplatform projects] (Gradle only)
* Builds projects for multiple platforms (JVM, JS, Native) using a single common project
